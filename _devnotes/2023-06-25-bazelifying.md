## Goals

- Dramatically reduce the amount of work required to migrate a ROS project to use Bazel.
    - Better understand the required work: What are the required steps? What makes it so laborious?
- Understand the strengths and weaknesses of using LLM in a nontrivial project.
    - Can it be used to dramatically improve developer velocity?
        - Bazel migration requires at least a few weeks of an engineering team's time. Can it be done by a single person in a few days?

### Expected Impact

- ...

## Background Research

### Using Bazel as a Build System for ROS

- For motivation and past discussions, check out [Adding Bazel as an official alternative build system for ROS2 Iron?](https://discourse.ros.org/t/adding-bazel-as-an-official-alternative-build-system-for-ros2-iron/28476).
- Existing projects:
    - [mvukov/rules_ros2](https://github.com/mvukov/rules_ros2)
    - [ApexAI/rules_ros](https://github.com/ApexAI/rules_ros)
    - [RobotLocomotion/drake-ros/tree/main/bazel_ros2_rules](https://github.com/RobotLocomotion/drake-ros/tree/main/bazel_ros2_rules)
- Presentations:
    - [BazelCon 2019 Day 2: Building Self Driving Cars with Bazel + Q&A](https://youtu.be/fjfFe98LTm8)
    - [BazelCon 2019 Day 1: Building Self Driving Cars with Bazel](https://youtu.be/Gh4SJuYUoQI)
    - [Bazel and ROS 2 â€“ building large scale safety applications](https://vimeo.com/767139879)

#### Challenges

- Bazelifying all external dependencies.
    - Cruise guys mention this in their talk and in ROS Discourse.
- (WIP) Something about Python.
    - TODO: Find mvukov's comment (in [mvukov/ruls_ros](https://github.com/mvukov/rules_ros), I think) that describes the challenges of specifying Python dependencies in Bazel.

TODO: Briefly mention the maintenance work too. Do a back-of-envelope calculation for the frequency/amount of the maintenance work.

#### Existing Approaches

1. Using ROS as system dependencies in Bazel.
2. Updating ROS and all of its external dependencies to use Bazel.

### Candidate ROS Projects to Migrate

- [Autoware](https://autowarefoundation.github.io/autoware-documentation/main/)
    - Open-source Autonomous Driving Software Project built on ROS.
    - Great documentation.
    - Vibrant community.
        - [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/autowarefoundation/discussions)
        - [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/Q94UsPvReQ)
- [MoveIt 2](https://moveit.picknik.ai/main/index.html)
    - Open-source Robotic Manipulation Platform for ROS2.
    - Great documentation.
    - Vibrant community.
        - [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/ros-planning/discussions)
        - [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/RrySut8)

Other Candidates Considered:
- Nav2
- ...

### LLM-Powered Code Generation

### Initial Impressions on LLM Use Cases

- The "consumption" side of LLM use cases (e.g., code comprehension, summarization) can increase developer velocity.
- The "generation" side of LLM use cases (e.g., code completion, generation) is questionable; developers still need to check their code line-by-line.
- "Test case generation" is interesting.
    - [CodiumAI](https://www.codium.ai/) - Generating meaningful tests for busy devs
    - Creating test cases is more useful than generating untested code.
    - However, it's not TDD; developers still need to provide an initial implementation (I think).

#### AI Agents

- [Significant-Gravitas/AutoGPT](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT):
    - A pioneer AI agent.
    - I heard it has great documentation on what works and what doesn't, but I haven't been able to find it.
    - There are many alternatives and variants.
- [smol-ai/developer](https://github.com/smol-ai/developer):
    - An AI agent-like program synthesizer.
    - There are some alternatives and variants.
- [TheR1D/shell-gpt](https://github.com/TheR1D/shell_gpt):
    - It's not an AI agent, but it seems very customizable.

## Next Steps

1. [ ] Collect and analyze feedback for this idea.
    - Who cares about this?
        - Which (robotics) companies? Who are their customers?
    - Is the maintenance work a bigger or more laborious problem?
    - ...
1. [ ] Find a starting point; Couple ideas:
    1. Check out Autoware or MoveIt 2 and identify a leaf package to start converting to Bazel.
    1. Check out [mvukov/rules_ros2](https://github.com/mvukov/rules_ros2) and identify a list of challenges that the author overcame.
1. [ ] Assess pros and cons of AI agents:
    1. Try an AI agent to migrate a tiny ROS package to use Bazel.
    1. Search for AI agent TDD applications and try them out.
        - Can it migrate a tiny ROS package to use Bazel?
    1. Review how smol-ai/developer works.

### Misc.

- If the goal is to demonstrate the usefulness of LLM, I could focus on converting RVIZ plugins to foxglove extensions, which is another laborious task.
