Existing tools for setting robotics devenv require too much robotics software & devops knowledge.

## Goals

To simplify
1. Setting up remote robotics development environment
    - E.g., ROS project with a simulation that require GPU
    - E.g., for individual developers or teams
2. Running CI involving (high-fidelity) simulation tests
    - E.g., run 100 simulation tests in parallel easily

### Expected Impact

- Evaluating applicability of existing remote devenv services
- CI integration
    - No CD: [Airbotics](https://www.airbotics.io/) covers CD

## Background Research
