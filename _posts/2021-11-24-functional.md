At some point in my life, I realized that I wasn't listening to music ~~to join the revolution and change the world!~~to enjoy myself but to put my kids to asleep or to focus while I'm working.
This sad realization made me write this post.

## Functional Listening

Like many other new parents, I was introduced to [white noise](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DWUZ5bk6qqDSy?si=3494c78a527640a0) sounds when I was struggling to put my son to bed.
One day after a sleepless night, I found myself listening to the white noise sounds even when I was working.
I felt like good and focused.

I started exploring more noise sounds to see if any of them can boost my productivity because, at some point, I felt white noise was too harsh for my ears.
Then I found [brown noise](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DX4hpot8sYudB?si=60a31bdb113441e1), which was much wamer and easier to my ears than the white noise, and enjoyed listening to it for awhile.
However, after many days of listening to it for a longer period of time, it was too warm to the point where it made me feeling sleepy, esp., in Winter days with long nights.
So I moved on to listening to [pink noise](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DX5NgkFTxJ4Wv?si=7029f4a7ead24b4a), which felt like a great compromise between white noise and brown noise, which I still enjoy to time to time.

Around the similar time, my friend who is also a dad suggested me to checking out [fan noise](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DWUm4vT7WQxcD?si=e76c28f0c6574460).
I didn't like initially like it but it grew on me over time.
There was something about listening to a bit more familiar sounds that kept me listening to it despite the initial dislike.
This observation led me to explore non-synthetic noise sounds like [nature sounds](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DX4PP3DA4J0N8?si=27f759d1d5064e9d), specifically, [ocean sounds](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DWV90ZWj21ygB?si=2db0493068e7492f) and [rain sounds](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DX8ymr6UES7vc?si=f00d14203b384061).
What I really liked about listening to nature sounds was that it not only was more comfortable to listening to than synthetic noise sounds like white noise, but also listening to them put me into the certain mental state that had certain effect on me.
For example, listening to the wave noise tricked my brain to put me into the vacation mode that helped me to relax and the heavy rain sounds took me back to the hot and humid monson season I weirdly enjoyed in South Korea when I was a kid.

Understanding listening to certain sounds (or music) having certain effects on me made me want to leverage such effects.
For example, I intentionally listened to my favorite finals week music from colleage years like Nujabes like lofi-hiphop music, Bon Iver like indie folk music, and Sigur Ros post-rock music when I needed to learn something, e.g., new techniques or tools.
I listened my favorite coding music from bachelor years like Chemical Brothers like big beats electronica or Daft Punk liks French house music when I need to pump out code, and nature sounds like ocean sounds that help me calm down/deteach from problems like when I'm responding to an incident under timre pressure.

At the end, I didn't find the music that would boost my productivity--like coffee that gives me that kick--but acquired this understanding to do better control mental state, which I believe led me to be more productive in general.

## Generalization to Lights and Screen Color Temperature 

During the pandemic, specifically in the winter of 2020, I learned how sensitive I was to the lighting conditions in my room.
At the time, I was using a single not-so-bright yellow light bulb in my room realized that I needed a much brighter light bulb, and for some reason, I wanted its color to be white.
So, I got a smart light bulb because I wanted to try a smart light build for a long time and in case I wanted to change my light's color to familar yellow.
But it was not bright enough, and I couldn't find a brighter smart light bulb, so I got three light bulbs (horizontal scaling works!).

Quickly, I realized that the bright white lights looked terrible at night times. Also, I felt too awake under those bright white lights. I programmed them using their IFTTT-like feature to change the lights throughout the day.


During the pandamic, specifically in the winter of 2020, I've learned how sensitive I was to lighting condition of my office.
At the time, my office was a [den space]() with a single not-so-bright yellow light bulb.
I needed a much brighter light bulb and for some reason I wanted the its color to be white.
So I got a [smart light bulb]() (just because I wanted to try it out/in case I want to change my light color to yellow)!
But it was not bright enough and I couldn't find a brigher smart light bulb, so got a three light bulbs (horizontal scaling works!).

Quckly I realized the bright white lights look terrible at night times.
Also I felt too awake under those bright white lights.
I ~~Programmaed them~~used their IFTTT like feature to change the lights through out the day.
- 6am: set brightness to X, set color temperature to Y
- 10am: set brightness to X, set color temperature to Y
- 11am: set brightness to X, set color temperature to Y
- 2pm: set brightness to X, set color temperature to Y
- 4pm: set brightness to X, set color temperature to Y
- 8pm: set brightness to X, set color temperature to Y
- 12pm: set brightness to X, set color temperature to Y
Yes, there was "sun sync" option but it asked me to share my location and I didn't want to do that.

Then I realized the screen color temperature was bothering me.
Night shift mode.
Easpecially at night, my eyes were hurting.
Btw, I'm not a fan of dark mode--for work mode. I just liked white background.
I felt like it was helping my eyes to rest.
So didn't really use darkmode that came with mac, etc.

Anways, on mac machines, night shift option solved this problem.
My work Ubuntu machine, I had rules like ...
Roughly 500~1000K less than the bightness

Funny thing about having these is that it sorted of acted like a trigger.
I like to hide menubar to maximimze screen space, also don't like having clock somewhere that always remind me of the time.
I like to look it up when I want to.

IT's gentle reminder of how much time has passed, knowing which time of a day is--which was esp important during pandemic when it wasn't clear what time it was anymore.

Around that time when I started practicing "Functional Listening", 

Lightening & Screen Color Temper
During pandemic, esp., winter time.
I really needed new lights, they were too yellow and not bright enough!
I got these Wyze lights like 3 of them.

Initially, I had them setup to full brightness and whitest color temperature all the time.
Then I realized that (not only it looked ugly in the evening) I felt too awake.
(I also realized that mac introduced night shift, etc.)

Created a simple rule to turn to yellow after 5pm (also great reminder for me to get ready for dinner)
(I try to hide menubar to really concentrate)
and turn it back to 8am, great reminder for get my kids ready for daycare.

I realized that mac's introduced "night shift" at some point.
Ended up applying


## Enlightment, Connecting back to research

Also remembered my friend telling me meditation is about observing and understading how your body and mind works.
I was made today, what was the real trigger?

This led me to think about ask can I achieve better understanding of how my mind & body works by e.g., learning from data?
Take a computational approach and use algorithm to find a setup environment & trigger that maximizes my productivity given model?

Qualify-self movement ...
I remembered there were HCI group studying the effect of environment on ourselves.

I think I went too crazy but even something simple might just work.
Tricks to calm myself down, etc.

<!-- model my cause & effect
What other environments can I control  / boost my productivity (related stuff)? -->

--

Essentially, these setup felt like ways to boost up my productivity.
Creating environment to boost my productivity.
There were some effects on things.

At somepoint quantify self was popular.
If we can measure productivity somehow, and can create the correlation between certain setup and my productivity, I can create an objective that finds environment that gets my maximum productivity!
This is like next stage of quantify self stuff!

Even more, if there are known science (pool of data that such correlcations can be learend), setting up that encourages.
Maybe these are what behavior chane science is about. urgh I should really read some of these ...
Maybe this is , moved away dieting apps, here goes productive!

<!-- Write littebit above generative music, images, what about ligetnign pattern and others? -->
<!-- Wearable (socks & eye patch) and timer/reminder functionality, e.g., abrupt vs smooth, e.g., start with "weird things I noticed ..." -->
<!-- implicit interaction -->
