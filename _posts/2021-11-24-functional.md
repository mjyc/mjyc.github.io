## Sounds

Like many other parents, I was introduced to noise sounds (e.g., white noise, fan noise) when I was struggling to put my son to bed.
There was something so soothing about listening to those noises that I kept listening to them even when I was working.
<!-- This was beginning of obsession with noise sounds. -->

<!-- Spotify offered lots of . -->
I started listening to variations.
White noise: too harsh
Brown noise: realized the warm bass sounds. but too warm, too sleepy
Pink noise: a bit better
Fan noise: My friend told me this is he liked fan noise. I started listening to it, didn't like it at first, but saw it was working really well for

Talking about variations, just listning to white noise made my ears numb at some point. (is it bad?)
Then started venturing into something different.
Nature sounds, for rain sounds, river stream sounds
Ocean sounds for ocean sounds.

Then I stumbled upon "Focus" and "Sleep" Genre.
That really spiced things up.
In college I used to enjoy listening to nosaj things, etc.
There was "bit"
I also liked listening to "post rock" music
floating into the space.

## Lights & Screen Color Temperature

Lightening & Screen Color Temper
During pandemic, esp., winter time.
I really needed new lights, they were too yellow and not bright enough!
I got these Wyze lights like 3 of them.

Initially, I had them setup to full brightness and whitest color temperature all the time.
Then I realized that (not only it looked ugly in the evening) I felt too awake.
(I also realized that mac introduced night shift, etc.)

Created a simple rule to turn to yellow after 5pm (also great reminder for me to get ready for dinner)
(I try to hide menubar to really concentrate)
and turn it back to 8am, great reminder for get my kids ready for daycare.

I realized that mac's introduced "night shift" at some point.
Ended up applying


## Enlightment, Connecting back to research

Essentially, these setup felt like ways to boost up my productivity.
Creating environment to boost my productivity.
There were some effects on things.

At somepoint quantify self was popular.
If we can measure productivity somehow, and can create the correlation between certain setup and my productivity, I can create an objective that finds environment that gets my maximum productivity!
This is like next stage of quantify self stuff!

Even more, if there are known science (pool of data that such correlcations can be learend), setting up that encourages.
Maybe these are what behavior chane science is about. urgh I should really read some of these ...
Maybe this is , moved away dieting apps, here goes productive!

<!-- Write littebit above generative music, images, what about ligetnign pattern and others? -->
<!-- Wearable (socks & eye patch) and timer/reminder functionality, e.g., abrupt vs smooth, e.g., start with "weird things I noticed ..." -->
<!-- implicit interaction -->
