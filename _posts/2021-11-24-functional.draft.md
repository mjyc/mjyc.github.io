Got into bianual beats and "Focus" and "Sleep" Genre.

for a longer period of time (e.g., over 2 hours) made my ears numb
 and slowly started listening to different noise sounds like [brown noise](), [pink noise]() and [fan noise]().


<!-- Spotify offered lots of . -->
I started listening to variations.
White noise: too harsh
Brown noise: realized the warm bass sounds. but too warm, too sleepy
Pink noise: a bit better
Fan noise: My friend told me this is he liked fan noise. I started listening to it, didn't like it at first, but saw it was working really well for

Talking about variations, just listning to white noise made my ears numb at some point. (is it bad?)
Then started venturing into something different.
Nature sounds, for rain sounds, river stream sounds
Ocean sounds for ocean sounds.

Then I stumbled upon "Focus" and "Sleep" Genre.
That really spiced things up.
In college I used to enjoy listening to nosaj things, etc.
There was "bit"
I also liked listening to "post rock" music
floating into the space.

One day (after a sleepless night), I found myself listening to noise sounds while I was working.
I felt like I was in the zone.

One day, I realized that I feel more focused playing noise sounds while working 

After many sleepless nights with noise sound tracks on, I found myself listening to them even when I was working.
There was something very soothing about the noise sounds.

After sleepless nights (and days) with 
There was something so soothing about listening to those noises that I kept listening to them even when I was working.
<!-- This was beginning of obsession with noise sounds. -->

One thing I learned from pandamic is controlling myself by controlling environment. / Controlling Tiny space around me to post productivity. Environment around me to boost productivity

Digital environment

I realize that I my productivity gets affected by big Time by lights and sounds both of which I could control digitally.

For environment light, I use smart lied to sync the color temperature time of the day. This helps me to be more awake during the daytime, and not overstimulate myself during the evening hours. Apparently this is backed by science or something I can’t find reference.

Similarly, screen brightness affect my productivity to this can be controlled by Night Shift, which comes with MacBook for the Ubuntu machine I just used Cron job and command line tools.

I believe you can go crazy and try to change the background colors or switch between dark at light mode, but just changing the color temperature was enough for me.

As for sounds, this is interesting one I generally listen to Nature Sounds to come down. I tried white noise or various noises to boost my concentration, level or masks are there noises but Nature Sounds worked best for me especially after I got noise canceling your phone. During college days, I used to listen to Post rock or folk music to concentrate during the daytime and listen to electronic music to get into the zone. No saj things. Which I still sometimes too, (and calm classical music ). but they tend to gets me to excited then I hope to OK maybe maybe I am OK with some of them during the day at night time Nature Sounds or sleep music helps me calm down.


Physical environment. Physical environment is difficult to control because it requires physical labor which is expensive.

One thing I found most helpful is closed office walls. I get to carry these wherever I go in but it around me to start work king.

Another thing is Ivan’s and earbuds. As a family man, my sleep is messed up and I need to be able to sleep whenever I can especially I need to go into deep sleep to maximize my time to do this eyepatch and earbuds helps me big time. It helps me to be able to sleep 30 minutes or while traveling to catch up with sleep.


Talk bit about generative music
Talk a bit about all these behavioral science stuff, idea of
Figuring out the best environment that best maximizes my productivity
