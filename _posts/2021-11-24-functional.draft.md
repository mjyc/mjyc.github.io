One thing I learned from pandamic is controlling myself by controlling environment. / Controlling Tiny space around me to post productivity. Environment around me to boost productivity

Digital environment

I realize that I my productivity gets affected by big Time by lights and sounds both of which I could control digitally.

For environment light, I use smart lied to sync the color temperature time of the day. This helps me to be more awake during the daytime, and not overstimulate myself during the evening hours. Apparently this is backed by science or something I can’t find reference.

Similarly, screen brightness affect my productivity to this can be controlled by Night Shift, which comes with MacBook for the Ubuntu machine I just used Cron job and command line tools.

I believe you can go crazy and try to change the background colors or switch between dark at light mode, but just changing the color temperature was enough for me.

As for sounds, this is interesting one I generally listen to Nature Sounds to come down. I tried white noise or various noises to boost my concentration, level or masks are there noises but Nature Sounds worked best for me especially after I got noise canceling your phone. During college days, I used to listen to Post rock or folk music to concentrate during the daytime and listen to electronic music to get into the zone. No saj things. Which I still sometimes too, (and calm classical music ). but they tend to gets me to excited then I hope to OK maybe maybe I am OK with some of them during the day at night time Nature Sounds or sleep music helps me calm down.


Physical environment. Physical environment is difficult to control because it requires physical labor which is expensive.

One thing I found most helpful is closed office walls. I get to carry these wherever I go in but it around me to start work king.

Another thing is Ivan’s and earbuds. As a family man, my sleep is messed up and I need to be able to sleep whenever I can especially I need to go into deep sleep to maximize my time to do this eyepatch and earbuds helps me big time. It helps me to be able to sleep 30 minutes or while traveling to catch up with sleep.
