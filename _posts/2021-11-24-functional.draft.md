## Towards Having Control Over Your Productivity

The goal was to improve my productivity.
What I found was not a coffee but better way to utilize productivity / attention resource by hacking myself.

It all started from these observations:
- certain things puts me into certain mood
- environmental cues "trigger" (implicit interaction)

and potentially leveraging them.

A few fun idea came to my head.
Building good model (via data collected from quantify self) and query "best placement".
Habituation, sequence, etc. but more data it's possible? Interesting idea

<!-- Implicit interaction, HCI stuff -->

For me, what I do is enough, for now.
Try to really understand how my both works.
I should get into mediation.

It was really effective during pandemic when it was easy to forther 
When I'm working, I like to hide the menubar (where the clock is located at) to maximize screen space, and hence often forget what time it is.
The light changes acted as a gentle reminder of how much time has passed and which time of day it is—which was especially important during the pandemic when it wasn't clear what time it was anymore. 
I created a simple rule to turn the lights yellow after 5 pm (also a great reminder for me to get ready for dinner) and turn them back to 8 am, which is a great reminder to get my kids ready for daycare.
(I try to hide the menubar to really concentrate).

<!-- However, one problem with not using the dark mode is that my eyes hurt looking at white backgound at night times.
On both [macOS](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207513) and [Ubuntu](https://help.ubuntu.com/stable/ubuntu-help/display-night-light.html.en), I noticed they recently introduce the night shift feature, which changes screen display color to a warmer color after the sunset, and using it helped my eyes to rest. -->

While they are on and off by sunset and sunsrise, I enjoyed changing them via cronjob to cause the trigger effect.
To I played with customizing dynamic wallpaper as well.

<!-- Because it was time based, it had similar effect on me.
I tried going all the way and having a similar number of rules like I did with lights but light was the main reminder.
It may have been useful if I was using desktop and lights wasn't there.

While working on this, I realized that there are other things I could do.
For example, I could dynamic wallpaper that tells me time of the day. -->

<!-- 
Easpecially at night, my eyes were hurting.
Then I realized the screen color temperature was bothering me.
Anways, on mac machines, night shift option solved this problem.
My work Ubuntu machine, I had rules like ...
Roughly 500~1000K less than the bightness

Had a similar "trigger" effect.
I noticed through out the day, ...

Also remembered my friend telling me meditation is about observing and understading how your body and mind works.
I was made today, what was the real trigger?

This led me to think about ask can I achieve better understanding of how my mind & body works by e.g., learning from data?
Take a computational approach and use algorithm to find a setup environment & trigger that maximizes my productivity given model?

Qualify-self movement ...
I remembered there were HCI group studying the effect of environment on ourselves.

I think I went too crazy but even something simple might just work.
Tricks to calm myself down, etc. -->

<!-- model my cause & effect
What other environments can I control  / boost my productivity (related stuff)? -->

--

Essentially, these setup felt like ways to boost up my productivity.
Creating environment to boost my productivity.
There were some effects on things.

At somepoint quantify self was popular.
If we can measure productivity somehow, and can create the correlation between certain setup and my productivity, I can create an objective that finds environment that gets my maximum productivity!
This is like next stage of quantify self stuff!

Even more, if there are known science (pool of data that such correlcations can be learend), setting up that encourages.
Maybe these are what behavior chane science is about. urgh I should really read some of these ...
Maybe this is , moved away dieting apps, here goes productive!

<!-- Wearable (socks & eye patch) and timer/reminder functionality, e.g., abrupt vs smooth, e.g., start with "weird things I noticed ..." -->

<!-- realized that I needed a much brighter light bulb, and for some reason, I wanted its color to be white.
So, I got a smart light bulb because I wanted to try a smart light build for a long time and in case I wanted to change my light's color to familar yellow.
Having one wasn't bright enough and because I couldn't find a much brighter smart light bulb, I got a 3-in-1 light socket splitter and two more bulbs to make my room brighter--horizontal scaling works -->

During the pandemic, specifically in the winter of 2020, I learned how sensitive I was to the lighting conditions in my room.
At the time, I was using a single not-so-bright yellow light bulb in my room realized that I needed a much brighter light bulb, and for some reason, I wanted its color to be white.
So, I got a smart light bulb because I wanted to try a smart light build for a long time and in case I wanted to change my light's color to familar yellow.
But it was not bright enough, and I couldn't find a brighter smart light bulb, so I got three light bulbs (horizontal scaling works!).

Quickly, I realized that the bright white lights looked terrible at night times.
Also, I felt too awake under those bright white lights. I programmed them using their IFTTT-like feature to change the lights throughout the day.

Around that time when I started practicing "Functional Listening", 

Lightening & Screen Color Temper
During pandemic, esp., winter time.
I really needed new lights, they were too yellow and not bright enough!
I got these Wyze lights like 3 of them.

Initially, I had them setup to full brightness and whitest color temperature all the time.
Then I realized that (not only it looked ugly in the evening) I felt too awake.
(I also realized that mac introduced night shift, etc.)

Got into bianual beats and "Focus" and "Sleep" Genre.

for a longer period of time (e.g., over 2 hours) made my ears numb
 and slowly started listening to different noise sounds like [brown noise](), [pink noise]() and [fan noise]().


<!-- Spotify offered lots of . -->
I started listening to variations.
White noise: too harsh
Brown noise: realized the warm bass sounds. but too warm, too sleepy
Pink noise: a bit better
Fan noise: My friend told me this is he liked fan noise. I started listening to it, didn't like it at first, but saw it was working really well for

Talking about variations, just listning to white noise made my ears numb at some point. (is it bad?)
Then started venturing into something different.
Nature sounds, for rain sounds, river stream sounds
Ocean sounds for ocean sounds.

Then I stumbled upon "Focus" and "Sleep" Genre.
That really spiced things up.
In college I used to enjoy listening to nosaj things, etc.
There was "bit"
I also liked listening to "post rock" music
floating into the space.

One day (after a sleepless night), I found myself listening to noise sounds while I was working.
I felt like I was in the zone.

One day, I realized that I feel more focused playing noise sounds while working 

After many sleepless nights with noise sound tracks on, I found myself listening to them even when I was working.
There was something very soothing about the noise sounds.

After sleepless nights (and days) with 
There was something so soothing about listening to those noises that I kept listening to them even when I was working.
<!-- This was beginning of obsession with noise sounds. -->

One thing I learned from pandamic is controlling myself by controlling environment. / Controlling Tiny space around me to post productivity. Environment around me to boost productivity

Digital environment

I realize that I my productivity gets affected by big Time by lights and sounds both of which I could control digitally.

For environment light, I use smart lied to sync the color temperature time of the day. This helps me to be more awake during the daytime, and not overstimulate myself during the evening hours. Apparently this is backed by science or something I can’t find reference.

Similarly, screen brightness affect my productivity to this can be controlled by Night Shift, which comes with MacBook for the Ubuntu machine I just used Cron job and command line tools.

I believe you can go crazy and try to change the background colors or switch between dark at light mode, but just changing the color temperature was enough for me.

As for sounds, this is interesting one I generally listen to Nature Sounds to come down. I tried white noise or various noises to boost my concentration, level or masks are there noises but Nature Sounds worked best for me especially after I got noise canceling your phone. During college days, I used to listen to Post rock or folk music to concentrate during the daytime and listen to electronic music to get into the zone. No saj things. Which I still sometimes too, (and calm classical music ). but they tend to gets me to excited then I hope to OK maybe maybe I am OK with some of them during the day at night time Nature Sounds or sleep music helps me calm down.


Physical environment. Physical environment is difficult to control because it requires physical labor which is expensive.

One thing I found most helpful is closed office walls. I get to carry these wherever I go in but it around me to start work king.

Another thing is Ivan’s and earbuds. As a family man, my sleep is messed up and I need to be able to sleep whenever I can especially I need to go into deep sleep to maximize my time to do this eyepatch and earbuds helps me big time. It helps me to be able to sleep 30 minutes or while traveling to catch up with sleep.


Talk bit about generative music
Talk a bit about all these behavioral science stuff, idea of
Figuring out the best environment that best maximizes my productivity
