Hi Leila, thanks for this email and stoked to hear what you plan to do in your keynote speech! That's awesome.


Other than thoughts I shared over the form, here are my additional thoughts I wanted to share with you.

- What expertees do industry want from HRI graduate students/researchers? The list of the headings in this list is my current answer.
- For the HRI researchers focused on engineering, some advice I'd like to give are
    - Do internships!
    - Based on my interview experience with companies, while most (bigger) companies wanted a roboticist with a specialized skill set (e.g., perception, control, motion planning, grasping, etc.) but some understand the value of those who can work between teams, which is the value HRI graduate students usually acquire. My advice is try to identify those who understand the value of an interdisciplinary engineer before or during the interview process.
        - Other than a "roboticist" role, a software engineering role involving (traditional) user interface work (including command line interface), data (visualization, collection), and test tools (e.g., defining test specification for complex physical behavior, interaction, etc.) may be relevant.

Not sure if this goes well with your talk but if you do mention these ideas, I'd like to be cited so I can help HRI grad students & researchers to find a place in industry (and continue to bridge the gap!)


I couldn't think of the names of HRI folks that you may not know. I personally would like to hear thoughts from Eric Deng, Meg Tonkin, Alison Riddal so I will send them a linkedin message soon.

Great to hear from you and looking forward to hearing your talk at HRI 2022!
