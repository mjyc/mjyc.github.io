## Lastly

Let me know what your thoughts in below the comments section!

- Was this post (not) useful for you? Which part was especially (not) useful?
- Do you have any insights on the topics discussed here? Any insights you strongly (dis)agree?
- Anything else?

I'd love to know.

- _Product manager._
    This is interesting one.
    Product manager is not a product designer, they are in charge of the whole process of product development
    It's not immediately clear what kind of HRI researchers would transition 
    One thing I noticed is having a knack for business.

<!-- - _QA/Tester._
    ... -->

- _Robotic Perception, Motion Control and Planning._
    More recently, I see more and more HRI researchers have competent core robotics skills such as Robotic Perception, Motion Control and Planning.
    If this is you, 
    <!-- I see more and more HRI researchers have competitant Robotic Perception, Motion Control and Planning background.
    If those are your strong suite, your should persue these -->
    <!-- TODO: Say what I said to Amal here -->

- _Researcher._
    :P this isn't really useful one but there are HRI research roles.

- _Create your own role._

Varies a lot.

## Part 2

I did not do internship at tech companies when I was undergraduate, so I didn't know what it was like to work at a tech company.
Here are couple things I picked up.
I realized what I wanted were:

1. I like to work on high-impact problem
1. I like to control what I work on
1. Work together effectively

To achieve 1., 
1. understand org chart, what each teams' territory, how teams collaborate together
1. understand how decisions are being made; who are the stakeholders? what's the path?--who is deciding what I work on daily, who makes/part takes decision on that, etc.

To achieve 2.,
1. understand the business, how are they making/plan to money
1. which teams contribute how? which teams seems "core"?

To achieve 3.
1. 


General things. 

Control what gets served on your plate
- start from 
Check out the dam org chart.
You want ot have control over what you do.
Understand which team is doing what
See how the decisions are getting made.

    things I needed to adjust were picking up tools and technologies that are "industry standard", e.g., React for front-end, and learning .
    I also needed to tame my urge to try to get involved in 

    <!-- TODO: site the mind map of frontend/backend -->
    reducing scope
    
    that concerns with the server side of software stack .
    work on layer that users see and Full-stack Engineer build entire application.
    HRI researchers who built (novel) systems may enjoy these roles.
    There are 

    <!-- What is their role? -->
    Front-end engineers user interface.
    HRI alums who built systems, etc. may enjoy this role.
    Something to note is that, conventions, etc., which you can pick up from hanging out in forums, etc,
    <!-- I focused on building systems that later evluated via user studies, etc.
    Skills could be transferred. -->

, here are roles that 
Fast forward to today, I have better idea where I would fit, which role in robotics companies, more specifically organizations < 500 ppl and bigger than > 20 (not garage startup).
<!-- (different) organizations. -->
I've also observing what roles the other HRI colleagues have been taking. watching their career.

Here are roles that I think those who have done HRI research can leverage their skills.

was about and hence which role I would be a good fit.
After spending some time in the industry, 

Unlike my peers in other robotics lab who focused on robotic perception or motion planning & control, ... it wasn't clear what to do.

After spending some time at robotics startups, here are roles that I think are well-fit for those who have done PhD in HRI.
