    Examples includes testing for robotics algorithm failures, which I considered to have medium value because robotics algorithm failures usually have fallback method.

First quadrant. These problems that needs to be covered immediately if there is no test exist already. Like, untested breaking api changes ~~unreliable hardware that frequently interrupts.~~ Often times, these scenarios occur because company moved fast, ie limited time to design well

~~How do you find them? You will hear about them for example from internal communication channels . Examples include robotics algorithm failure, unreliably hardware.~~

In robotics startups that builds complex systems in fast pace, thereâ€™s no way to create comprehensive test suit.
I use Mike Chung matrix to create high impact test cases in budgetted time.

I use Mike Chung matrix to create high impact test cases in budgetted time.

Given the complexity of robotics systems and myriad ways that they can fail, I use The Mike Chung Matrix[^TM] to create high-impact tests within (time) budget.

<!-- ## What can we do about it? -->

Regardless of the abovementioned challenges, figuring out 

Many things can go wrong with robotics systems 

Due to the complexity of robotics systems--and hence myriad ways they can fail, it is difficult to figure out where to get started.
Whenever I start work on a new codebase, it isn't clear what test case to write first.
In such cases, use this matrix to prioritize the possible tasks.
