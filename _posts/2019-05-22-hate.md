I don't like [robots that tell jokes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWlL4KjIP4M).
Humor is a complex concept and I don't think [humans fully understand how humor works](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/03/funny-how/550910/).
So trying to make robots say something funny feels wrong.
I don't like [robots that dance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1DuJQL8spY).
The robots are not as agile as we humans and every time I see dancing robots, they look like they don't want to dance but were forced to do it.
But we make them tell jokes or dance [again](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poh5zSsd1rE&t=3s), [again](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am1csALyEzE), [again](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2SDVQCzQoA), [again](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiTGaacQ7Og), and [again](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHBcVlqpvZ8&t=1s).

Why?

### Updates

- _2021/01/06_ I found ["These Dancing Robots Are Not About Dance: waiving goodbye to 2020 and popular exploitations"](https://jessicarajko.medium.com/dancing-robots-are-not-about-dance-waiving-goodbye-to-2020-and-popular-exploitations-of-dance-961f57d3ee4c) by Jessica Rajko. It helped me understand where my hatred is coming from.
- _2021/01/03_ There was (yet another) robot dancing [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fn3KWM1kuAw) posted from Boston Dynamics. I was amazed at Boston Dynamics' technical achievement but something still bothered me.
- _2019/11/30_ Then there are portrait drawing robots \[[1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gG_pzgfeESs)[2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKx49hjHDGc)\], which we humans have been building since [1768](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/).
