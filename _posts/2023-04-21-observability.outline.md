Observability
Intro 
- [ ] Why observability?
    - [ ] Debugging
    - [ ] Alert
    - [ ] Insights
- [ ] Issues I’ve faced and insights

Logging
- [ ] Cannot get something useful
    - [ ] Talk about splunk and elastic search
    - [ ] Structure them
    - [ ] Backward competibility
- [ ] Centralization
    - [ ] The problem is about large data
    - [ ] Sync per datatype?
    - [ ] Chunk them
- [ ] Homogeneity?

Metrics
- [ ] Robo-metrics
    - [ ] Low level
    - [ ] Red

Conclusion
Observability is important at every stage (esp as the fleet grows) and scalable/performant robo-observability is must to grow the fleet/longer operations/larger teams and their demands.

Preparing for scale, I suggest
- [ ] Structuring logs and centralizing them
- [ ] Start discussing Metrics in design, working with robotics teamS

The difference Needs to be understood and handled—interesting area/high rewarding/important area to work on
