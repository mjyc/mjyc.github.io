NIce post on the difficulties of testing automation systems Mike! 

I am curious to hear your opinion on simulating tests for hardware issues. How can this be achieved efficiently? 

Indeed, the search space is unbounded. Anything can go wrong at the hardware level and potentially affect the system, or break it. Is it therefore possible for a developer, or even an AI, to create a test for everything that could go wrong? Would using HITL tests be more approprioate?
