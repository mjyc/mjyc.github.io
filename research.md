I graduated from the University of Washington in 2020.
Here is my [recorded dissertation](https://youtu.be/pTml6yEIjcw) and [CV]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/pdfs/Curriculum%20Vitae%20-%20Michael%20Jae-Yoon%20Chung.pdf).

My research in graduate school was on human-robot interaction.
I particularly enjoyed thinking about programming systems for robots in human environments; I drew inspirations from programming languages, web development, product design, and startup communities.
