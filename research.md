I received my Ph.D. from [University of Washington](https://www.cs.washington.edu/).
Here is my [thesis]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/pdfs/PhD%20Thesis%20-%20Michael%20Jae-Yoon%20Chung.pdf) [talk](https://youtu.be/pTml6yEIjcw).

My research in graduate school was on human-robot interaction.
I particularly enjoyed thinking about programming systems for robots in human environments; I drew inspirations from programming languages, web development, product design, and startup communities.
