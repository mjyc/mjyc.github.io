    <p>I don‚Äôt like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWlL4KjIP4M">robots that tell jokes</a>.
Humor is a complex concept and I don‚Äôt think <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/03/funny-how/550910/">even we humans don‚Äôt fully understand how it works</a> so trying to make robots say something funny feels like a futile effort.
I also don‚Äôt like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1DuJQL8spY">robots that dance</a>.
The robots are not as agile as we humans and every time I see dancing robots, they look like they don‚Äôt want to dance but were forced to do it.</p>

<p>But we make them tell jokes and dance <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poh5zSsd1rE&amp;t=3s">again</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am1csALyEzE">again</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2SDVQCzQoA">again</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiTGaacQ7Og">again</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHBcVlqpvZ8&amp;t=1s">again</a>.
Why?
Do we just like them to entertain us?
I recently read about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gG_pzgfeESs">this portrait drawing robot</a> and I knew people who built <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKx49hjHDGc">a drawing robot</a> but it turns out we humans has been <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaquet-Droz_automata#The_draughtsman">building similar robots since since 1768</a>.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walt_Disney_Imagineering">Disney‚Äôs imagineering</a> have been doing robotics research for eventual entertainment purposes.
Among relatively recent products from robot starts, I found <a href="https://anki.com/en-us/cozmo.html">Anki‚Äôs Cozmo robot</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7r_Rty9HwHdUfq869Ss_tQ">contents involving it</a> the most amusing.</p>

<p>As a researcher in academia I never considered entertainment as a serious application.
But maybe it‚Äôs time to pay attention to applications or the potentials of robotics in entertainment.
And to be honest, I do kind of like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHBcVlqpvZ8&amp;t=5s">UpTown Spot</a>.</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>2020/01/06</em> There was (yet another) robot dancing video posted from Boston Dynamics. I was amazed at Boston Dynamics‚Äô technical achievement but something still bothered me.
Then I found <a href="https://jessicarajko.medium.com/dancing-robots-are-not-about-dance-waiving-goodbye-to-2020-and-popular-exploitations-of-dance-961f57d3ee4c">‚ÄúThese Dancing Robots Are Not About Dance: waiving goodbye to 2020 and popular exploitations‚Äù</a> by Jessica Rajko; I still haven‚Äôt digested my take on this article but it helped me better understand why I have a certain attitude towards these joking and dancing robots.</li>
