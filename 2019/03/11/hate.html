<ul>
  <li><em>2021/01/06</em> I found <a href="https://jessicarajko.medium.com/dancing-robots-are-not-about-dance-waiving-goodbye-to-2020-and-popular-exploitations-of-dance-961f57d3ee4c">“These Dancing Robots Are Not About Dance: waiving goodbye to 2020 and popular exploitations”</a> by Jessica Rajko. It helped me understand where my hatred is coming from.</li>
  <li><em>2021/01/03</em> There was (yet another) robot dancing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fn3KWM1kuAw">video</a> posted from Boston Dynamics. I was amazed at Boston Dynamics’ technical achievement but something still bothered me.</li>
  <li><em>2019/11/30</em> Then there are portrait drawing robots [<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gG_pzgfeESs">1</a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKx49hjHDGc">2</a>], which we humans have been building since <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/">1768</a>.</li>
