Setting robotics development environment (DevEnv) is not for the faint-hearted.
When was the last time you were able to install and run an opensource robotics project successfully without troubleshooting?

This brief outlines the remote DevEnv project idea I'd like to explore one day.


## Goals

Simplify

1. Setting up robotics DevEnv
    - E.g., ROS project with a simulation that requires GPU
    - E.g., for individual developers or teams
2. Running simulation tests
    - E.g., 100 e2d simulation tests, in parallel

by leveraging remote DevEnv.

### Expected Outcomes

- Findings from setting up & running existing opensource robotics projects on cloud
- Evaluation of existing remote DevEnv services
- Findings from setting up & running simulation tests on cloud
