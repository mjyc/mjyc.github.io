Ever since I returned to Seattle, I have missed the vibrant robotics meetup scene of the Bay Area.
So I attended a couple of meetups in the area and found the following ones particularly interesting:

- [ROS Seattle Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/ROS-Seattle/): Software, robots, ... it felt like home.
- [Hardware Happy Hour (3H) Seattle](https://www.meetup.com/seattle-hardware-happy-hour-3h/): It's üï∂Ô∏è
- [Seattle Robotics Society](https://seattlerobotics.org/): It had an impressive history.

Then, in December 2020, I learned that the ROS Seattle Meetup was looking for a new organizer.
[Vaibhav Phadnis](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vaibhav-phadnis-4637b84/) and I stepped up as new co-organizers for 2021.
We liked the previous meetup format, with technical talks for the first half and networking for the second half.
Due to COVID, we needed everything to be virtual, so we used Zoom for talks and Gather for networking sessions.
Throughout 2020, we hosted about seven of these events, and we were able to record the last four, which you can find at the very end of this post.

I greatly enjoyed my role as a co-organizer for about a year.
I enjoyed the process of sourcing speakers, which had the side benefit of reconnecting me with old friends and introducing me to new concepts through talks at events like ROSCon, ROS-Industrial events, and more.
It also allowed me to make new friends while interacting with the speakers, whom we were able to invite from anywhere on earth! thanks to COVID?

I was unable to continue hosting in 2022 due to personal reasons.
However, I'd love to once again get involved in building robotics software developer community in the greater Seattle area, some time in future.
