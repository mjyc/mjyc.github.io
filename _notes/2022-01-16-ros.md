With [Vaibhav Phadnis](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vaibhav-phadnis-4637b84/), I hosted these ROS Seattle Meetup events:

<!-- Ever since I came back to Seattle from Bay Area, I missed vibrant robotics meetup events.
So I checked out robotics-related meetups and found:
- [ROS Seattle Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/ROS-Seattle/)
- [Seattle Robotics Society](https://seattlerobotics.org/)
- [Hardware Happy Hour (3H) Seattle](https://www.meetup.com/seattle-hardware-happy-hour-3h/)

I found ROS Seattle the most relevant to what I was interested in.
Seattle Robotics Society had a long traiditon and looked really interesting, they were focusing on education too which made it extra interesting.
Hardware Happy Hour (3H) Seattle.

There was a call that will be ended and while I was contemplating on stepping up Vihav saved the site!
I dmed him to join as an organizer.

We liked previous meetup, decided to follow a similar format.
We will be fionding people and network, we'll just do so over online using a tool like gather.
BEcause it was during covid, zoom + gather to .
This went on for about an year and record talks are available at the end

Here are few things I've learned from hosting.
- Using the current format Montly is too much. Many be for organizers as well as. difficult to find people and not too many people shows up, etc.
    I would try something like hardware meetup, jsut hanging out--then finding time is difficult.
- Focusing on tech talk, or go big or go home...
- More interactive session
    - ...
    - ligthening talk, etc.
- 

We orgainzed events for ~year and hosted talks and social events.
