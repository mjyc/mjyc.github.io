Ever since I returned to Seattle, I have missed the vibrant robotics meetups of the Bay Area. Consequently, I attended a couple of meetups in the area and found the following ones particularly interesting:

- [ROS Seattle Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/ROS-Seattle/): It felt like home.
- [Seattle Robotics Society](https://seattlerobotics.org/): Impressive history!
- [Hardware Happy Hour (3H) Seattle](https://www.meetup.com/seattle-hardware-happy-hour-3h/): I really enjoyed this one.

Then, in December 2020, I learned that the ROS Seattle Meetup was looking for a new organizer, and [Vaibhav Phadnis](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vaibhav-phadnis-4637b84/) and I stepped up as new co-organizers.
We liked the format of the previous meetups, with technical talks for the first half and networking for the second half.
Due to COVID, we needed everything to be virtual, so we used Zoom for talks and Gather for networking. Throughout 2020, we hosted about seven of these events, and we were able to record the last four:

I was unable to continue hosting in 2022 due to personal reasons, but I thoroughly enjoyed finding speakers for and meeting new people during these meetups.
Are you interested in organizing an event? Here are my two cents:

1. Hosting monthly meetups is no easy task, even with a co-organizer.
2. Have clear goals for yourself. Why are you hosting these events?

Once I regain my energy and clarity, I would love to give this another try.
