_DISCLAIMER: I only played with [theseus](https://github.com/facebookresearch/theseus) for ~1 week._

When I was just starting in gradschool, applying numerical methods to the robotics problems was scary (e.g., loop closure in SLAM, trajectory optimization for motion planning).
I hated deriving Jacobian matrix, ...

_I don't care, just show me the code!_

Okay okay, see [this PR](https://github.com/AtsushiSakai/PythonRobotics/pull/941). Briefly, I thought these features made thesues joyful to use:

- _Pytorch integration_ brings tons of tensor utilities, autograd, and more
- _Python implementation of nonliear & linear optimization algorithms_ makes it easy to see what's going on under the hood
- _Many robotics utility code (e.g., [geometry](https://github.com/facebookresearch/theseus/tree/main/theseus/geometry)), application [examples](https://github.com/facebookresearch/theseus/tree/main/examples)_
