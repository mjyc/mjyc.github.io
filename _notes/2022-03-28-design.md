I participated in [HRI2022](https://humanrobotinteraction.org/2022/) with two personal goals:

1. Documenting _design methods from human-robot interaction research_ for my colleagues in the industry.
2. Documenting interesting ways of applying the _reactive programming paradigm_ to interactive robot application programming tasks.

Here is the **HRI design methods** talk I presented at the [HRI-LSI Workshop Invited Talk](https://sites.google.com/view/lsi-hri/home):

At the [PD/EUP Workshop, HRI 2022 Workshop](https://sites.google.com/wisc.edu/hri22pdeupworkshop/home), I presented a talk on **robot application domain-specific language** (for details, see the [paper]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/pdfs/chung2022soboro.pdf)):

I also shared my thoughts on **testing tooling for robot applications** during the [Late-Breaking Reports](https://dblp.org/db/conf/hri/hri2022.html) session (for details, see the [paper]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/pdfs/chung2022authoring.pdf)):

It was extremely challenging to pull these off while working, and I'm not 100% sure if they hit the mark with the target audience I had in mindâ€”especially the reactive programming talks.
One lesson I've learned is that I should probably spend more time understanding my target audience's interests before preparing talks like these.
