I collected CDs in the 2000s and academic papers in the 2010s.
In the mid-2010s, when I carried over my curation habit to open-source projects, I stumbled upon these üï∂Ô∏èawesome lists while digging through GitHub repositories.

I loved the idea of using the keyword "awesome" to find amazing projects/tools.
For example, [awesome-shell](https://github.com/awesome-lists/awesome-bash), [awesome-go](https://github.com/avelino/awesome-go), and [awesome-robotics-libraries](https://github.com/jslee02/awesome-robotics-libraries) are my classic favorites.
Similar to a playlist of survey papers, I enjoyed the feeling of getting to know a creator's taste through exploring their awesome lists.
So, I created a set of awesome lists to share my own positionings, such as:

- [awesome-robotics-projects](https://github.com/mjyc/awesome-robotics-projects) - A list of open-source, affordable, less-known, or visionary robotics projects.
- [awesome-hri-papers-for-industry](https://github.com/mjyc/awesome-hri-papers-for-industry) - HRI Papers for Industry
- [awesome-robotics-companies](https://github.com/mjyc/awesome-robotics-companies)

Then, I thought it might be beneficial to share my robotics learning materials:

- [awesome-robotics-system-design](https://github.com/mjyc/awesome-robotics-system-design) - Stuff I read to learn about robotics system design
- [robotics-algorithm-repos](https://github.com/mjyc/robotics-algorithm-repos) - A curated list of robotics algorithms implementations I've directly or indirectly worked with before

Sharing learning materials motivated me to convert my research notes into awesome lists:

- [awesome-end-user-programming](https://github.com/mjyc/awesome-end-user-programming) - A list of my favorite end-user programming, crowdsourcing, programming languauges links
- [awesome-hri-datasets](https://github.com/mjyc/awesome-hri-datasets) - A curated list of publically available human-robot interaction datasets
- [hri-literature-spreadsheets](https://github.com/mjyc/hri-literature-spreadsheets)
- [awesome-behavioral-change](https://github.com/mjyc/awesome-behavioral-change)
- [awesome-tech-education](https://github.com/mjyc/awesome-tech-education)

Today, I come across numerous awesome lists, and I don't believe that blindly creating a new awesome list is particularly helpful for the community.
However, I still believe curation is a powerful way to share tastes, spark discussions, and find inspiration.
I'd like to observe (or steer?!) how such activities evolve over time within the open-source community, whether they remain within the "awesome" framework or not.
