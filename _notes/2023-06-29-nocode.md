No/low-code platforms have won the non-programmer users in the web development community.
Do we really need front-end developers for the robotics community?
So far yes, robotic front-end work requires special skills such as graphics programming on web (e.g., Three.js/Babylon.js, WebGL, Leaflet, etc.)
What can we do to enable designers to create robotics UIs by themselves?


## Goals

To enable designers to directly work with backend/product engineers.
Free engineers from implementing design details.


## Background Research

- Existing no-code tools/services fall short
    - Plasmic won't work for creating robotics data visualization components
        - But it could probably handle user interactions outside of visual components like map, 3D world, etc.
    - Q: Is there any no/low-code tools that will work for robotics data visualization?
    - What about providing:
        - A DSL like Vega-Lite
            - No more no-code, target users would be developers who doesn't have time
        - A library like Streamlit

### Possible Starting Points

- Trying to convert
    - Autoware RVIZ Plugins, e.g., to Foxglove components
    - ...

### Inspirations

- [Plasmic](https://plasmic.app/)
- [foxglove](https://foxglove.dev/)
- [Vega-Lite](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/)
- [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/)
